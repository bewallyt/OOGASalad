<h3>Overview</h3>
Read the design document (API_doc_updated.pdf) for a complete overview of this project.

This project consists of a game authoring environment and a game engine. The authoring environment allows the creation of custom 2D RPG games. These games are then saved to JSON formatted files, which can then be run on our game engine.
